/*
 * These Reply methods provide a simple way to send data to the client as a reply.
 * The reply length is automatically calculated and added at the end when |ReplyWriteToClient| is called
 * and byteswapped to the client if needed.
 * The |xGenericReply| section of the reply struct is automatically byteswapped (the sequence and length).
 * |ReplyAppendReplyStruct| has to be the first function called when adding data.
 * Example usage (without error checking for simplicity):
 *   xXF86VidModeGetMonitorReply rep = ...
 *   Reply reply; 
 *   ReplyInit(&reply, client);
 *   ReplyAppendReplyStruct(&reply, &rep, sizeof(rep));
 *   ReplyAppendCARD32(&reply, 32);
 *   ReplyWriteToClient(&reply);
 *   ReplyDeinit(&reply);
